# Contributions to the edX UX Pattern Library
Contributions to the edX UX Pattern library are very welcome, and strongly encouraged! Here's a step-by-step guide that should help you get started

## Step 0: Start a Conversation
Got an idea for how to improve the Pattern Library? Fantastic, we'd love to hear about it! Before you dive in and spend a lot of time and effort making a pull request, it's a good idea to discuss your idea with other interested designers/developers and/or the edX UX Team. You may get some valuable feedback that changes how you think about your idea, or you may find other designers/developers who have the same idea and want to work together.

If you've got an idea for a new feature or new functionality for an existing feature please create a new Github issue ([learn how to create an issue with Github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)) in this repository.

### Fixes and Small Improvements
If you are contributing for the first time, aren't sure what to work on, or want to help tackle some smaller things, have a look at the following:

* UX Pattern Library Issues - https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/issues
* UX Pattern Library Backlog - https://openedx.atlassian.net/browse/UX-1396

If you have questions, you can always email [ux@edx.org](mailto:ux@edx.org).

## Step 1: Sign a Contribution Agreement
Before edX can accept any code contributions from you, you'll need to sign
the [individual contributor agreement](http://open.edx.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/individual-contributor-agreement.pdf) and send it in. This confirms
that you have the authority to contribute the code in the pull request and
ensures that edX can relicense it.

You should print out the agreement and sign it. Then scan (or photograph) the
signed agreement and email it to the email address indicated on the agreement.
Alternatively, you're also free to physically mail the agreement to the street
address on the agreement. Once we have your agreement in hand, we can begin
reviewing and merging your work.

You'll also need to add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file when you submit your
first pull request.  You should add your full name as well as the email address
associated with your GitHub account.  Please update `AUTHORS` in an individual
commit, distinct from other changes in the pull request (it's OK for a pull
request to contain multiple commits, including a commit to `AUTHORS`).
Alternatively, you can open up a separate PR just to have your name added to
the `AUTHORS` file, and link that PR to the PR with your changes.

## Step 2: Fork, Commit, and Pull Request
GitHub has some great documentation on [how to fork a git repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo). Once
you've done that, make your changes and [send us a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)! Be sure to
include a detailed description for your pull request, so that a community
manager can understand *what* change you're making, *why* you're making it, *how* it should work now, and how you can *test* that it's working correctly.

## Step 3: Meet PR Requirements
Our [contributor documentation](http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-developer-guide/en/latest/process/contributor.html) includes a long list of requirements that pull requests must meet in order to be reviewed by a core committer. 

**NOTE**: some of the requirements listed in the contributor documentation may not apply to the UX Pattern Library to-date as, for example, there is currently not much automated testing needed.

In addition to the general contributor documentation, any contributions should meet specific Front End Development requirements, including the guidelines and principles listed in:

* [General Front End Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-General)
* [Accessibility Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Accessibility)
* [HTML Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-HTML)
* [Forms Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Forms)
* [Sass & CSS Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-Sass-&-CSS)
* [JavaScript Styleguide](https://github.com/edx/ux-pattern-library/wiki/Styleguide:-JavaScript)

## Step 4: Approval and Design/Code Review by edX UX Team Member
An edX UX team member will read the description of your pull request. If the
description is understandable, the team member will evaluate if the pull request is a good idea for the edX UX Pattern Library, and if not, your pull request will be rejected. This is another good reason why you should discuss your ideas before working on a pull request!

If your pull request is not rejected by a team member, then it will be scheduled for code review by one or more edX UX Team members. Once the design and code review process has started, please be responsive to comments on the pull request, so we can keep the review process moving forward.
If you are unable to respond for a few days, that's fine, but please add a comment informing us of that -- otherwise, it looks like you're abandoning your work!

## Step 5: Merge!
Once the team members are satisfied that your pull request is ready to go,
one of them will merge it for you. Your code will end up in edX and Open edX apps that leverage the UX Pattern Library. Congrats!

## Expectations We Have of You

By opening up a pull request, we expect the following things:

1. You've read and understand the instructions in this contributing file and
   the contribution process documentation.

2. You are ready to engage with the edX community. Engaging means you will be
   prompt in following up with review comments and critiques. Do not open up a
   pull request right before a vacation or heavy workload that will render you
   unable to participate in the review process.

3. If you have questions, you will ask them by commenting on the pull
   request.

4. If you do not respond to comments on your pull request within 7 days, we
   will close it. You are welcome to re-open it when you are ready to engage.

## Expectations You Have of Us

1. Within a week of opening up a pull request, one of our team members
   will triage it, starting the documented contribution process. (Please
   give us a little extra time if you open the PR on a weekend or
   around a US holiday! We may take a little longer getting to it.)

2. We promise to engage in an active dialogue with you from the time we begin
   reviewing until either the PR is merged (by a core committer), or we
   decide that, for whatever reason, it should be closed.
